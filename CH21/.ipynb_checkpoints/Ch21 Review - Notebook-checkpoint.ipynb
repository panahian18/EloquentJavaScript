    "In this final project chapter, our goal is to set up a website for managing talks given at a skill-sharing meeting. We want a system that will let the participants propose and discuss talks among themselves, without a central organizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a server part to this project, written for Node.js, and a client part written for the browser. The server keeps the list of talks proposed for the next meeting, and the client shows the list. Each talk has a presenter name, a title, and an array of comments associated with it. The client allows users to propose new talks. (adding them to the list), delete talks, and comment on existing talks. Whenever the user makes such a change, the client makes an HTTP request. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project requires that whenever someone submits a new talk or adds a comment all people who have the page open in their browser should immediately see the change. A solution to this problem is called long polling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Long Polling\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to notify a client that something has changed, we need a connection to  that client. However, browsers do not accept connections, and routers would block them anyway. Instead of having a server making a connection with the client, we have a client keep a connection open and keep it around so that the server can send information when it needs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, a client makes a simple HTTP request and the server comes back with a single response. Although we could use WebSockets, we will keep it simple and instead use long polling, where clients continuously ask the server for new information using regular HTTP requests, and the server stalls in its answer when it has nothing new to report. E.g. when a user has the site open in their browser, the browser will make a request for updates and will be waiting for a response to that request. When another user posts a new talk, the server will notice that the first user is waiting for an update and will send a response containing the new talk.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent connections from timing out (aborted due to lack of activity), long polling techniques usually set a maximum time for each request, after which the server will respond anyway, event when it has nothing to report, after which the client will make a new request. Periodically restarting the request also makes the technique more robust, allowing clients to recover from temporary connection failures or server problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "A GET reqeuest to /talks returns a JSON document like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "[{\n",
    "\"title\": \"Unituning\",\n",
    "\"presenter\": \"Jamal\",\n",
    "\"summary\": \"Modifying your cycle for extra style\",\n",
    "\"comments\": []\n",
    "}]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a new talk by making a PUT request to a URL like /talks/Unituning, where the part after the second slash is the title of the talk. The PUT request body then should contain a JSON object that has presenter and summary properties. The talk titles need to be encoded with the encodeURIComponent function when building a URL since some characters, like spaces, may not appear normally. \n",
    "\n",
    "A sample request to create a talk\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "PUT /talks/How%20toIdle%20Idle HTTP/1.1\n",
    "Content-Type: application/json\n",
    "Content-Length: 92\n",
    "\n",
    "{\"presenter\": \"Maureen\",\n",
    " \"summary\": \"Standing still on a unicycle\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Such urls also support GET requests to retrieve the JSON representation of a talk and DELETE requests to delete a talk. \n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a comment to a talk is done with a POST request to a URL like /talks/Unituning/comments, with a JSON body that has author and message properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "POST /talks/Unituning/comments HTTP/1.1\n",
    "Content-Type: application/json\n",
    "Content-Length: 72\n",
    "\n",
    "{\"author\": \"Iman\",\n",
    " \"message\": \"Will you talk about...\"}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to support long polling, we need 2 extra headers to notify the server to delay responses if no new information is available, ETag and If-None-Match. Servers use ETag (entity tag) header in a response, which has a value as a string that identifies the current version of the resource. When clients later make a request, they may make a conditional request by including an If-None-Match header whose value holds that same string. If the resource hasn't changed the server will respond with code 304, which means \"not modified\", telling the client that the cached version is still current. When the tag does not match, the server responds as normal. \n",
    "\n",
    "This mechanism allows the client to tell the server what version of the list of talks it has, and the server responds only when that list has changed. However, instead of returning a 304 response, the server instead stalls the response and only returns only when something new is available or a given amount of time has elapsed. We provide another header, Prefer: wait=90, which tells the server that the client is willing to wait up to 90 seconds for the response. The server will keep a version number that it updates every time the talks change and use that as the ETag value. Clients can make requests like this to be notified when the talks change:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "GET /talks HTTP/1.1\n",
    "If-None-Match: \"4\"\n",

    "In this section we will build the server-side part of the program, this code section runs on Node.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "Our server will use \"createServer\" to start an HTTP server. Before we can handle any new requests, we must be able to distinguish between the various kinds of requests (as determined by the method and the path) that we support. Instead of writing a long chain of if statements, we will use a router, which is a component that helps dispatch a request to a function that can handle it. E.g. you can tell a router that PUT requests with a path that matches the regular expression `/^\\/talks/\\([^\\/]+)$/` (/talks/ followed by a talk title) can be handled by a given function. In addition, it can help extract meaningful parts of the path (in this case the talk title), wrapped in parentheses in the regular expression, and pass them to the handler function. \n",
