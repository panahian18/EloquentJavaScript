    "When eloquentjavascript.net/18_http.html is entered into the browser's address bar, the browser first looks up the server associated with eloquentjavascript.net and tries to open a TCP connection to it on port 80, the default port for HTTP traffic. If the server exists and accepts the connection, the browser might send something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```HTML\n",
    "GET /18_http.html HTTP/1.1\n",
    "Host: eloquentjavascript.net\n",
    "User-Agent: Your browser's name\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then the server responds, through the same connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "```HTML\n",
    "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n",
    "Content-Size: 65582\n",
    "Content-Type: text/html\n",
    "Last-Modified: 01 Jan 21\n",
    "\n",
    "<!doctype html>\n",
    "... rest of document\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The browser takes the part of the response after the blank line, its body not the HTML body tag and displays it as an HTML document. The information sent by the client is called the request, it starts with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    GET /18_http.html HTTP/1.1\n",
    "\n",
    "GET is the method of the request, it means we want to get the specified resource. Other common methods are DELETE to delete a resource, PUT to create or replace it, and POST to send information to it. A server does not have to carry out every request it gets, e.g. request to DELETE a server's main page. \n",
    "\n",
    "The part after the resource is the path of the resource the request applies to. A resource can be a file on the server, but it doesn't have to be. Servers will often generate the response they produce on the fly. E.g. looking up a user's account on GitHub will check the database for their username and retrieve the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTTP/1.1 indicates the version of HTTP it's using. Many browsers now use version 2, but the browser will automatically switch to the appropriate protocol version when talking to a given server, and the outcome of a request is the same regardless of version used.\n",
    "\n",
    "The server's response will start with a version as well, followed by the status of the response, first as a 3 digit status code and then as a human-readable string. E.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "    HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n",
    "\n",
    "Codes starting with 2 mean the request succeeded, codes starting with 4 mean that there was something wrong with the request, 404 is the most famous one, meaning that the resource could not be found. Codes that start with 5 mean that an error happened on the server and the request is not to blame.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line of a request or response may be followed by any number of headers. These are lines in the form name: value that specify extra infor about the request or response. These headers were part of the example response:\n",
    "\n",
    "```HTML\n",
    "Content-Length: 65585\n",
    "Content-Type: text/html\n",
    "Last-Modified: THU, 04, Jan 2018 ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us that type of the document is HTML and the size is 65585 bytes. It also says when it was last modified. For most headers, the client or server are free to decide whether to include them. However, some are required. The Host header, which specifies the hostname should be included in the request because a server might be serving multiple hostnames on a single IP address. \n",
    "\n",
    "After the headers, both the request and response may include a blank line, followed by a body, which contains the data being sent. GET and DELETE requests don't send along any data, but PUT and POST do.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Browsers and HTTP\n",
    "\n",
    "When a url is entered in a browser address bar, the browser makes a request, then resulting HTML document may reference other files, such as images and javascript files, if so, those are retrieved too. This may included hundreds of files, browser's make requests concurrently to speed this process up.\n",
    "\n",
    "HTML pages may also include forms, which allow users to fill out information and send it to the server. This is an example of a form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```HTML\n",
    "<form method=\"GET\" action=\"example/message.html\">\n",
    "    <p>Name: <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\"></p>\n",
    "    <p>Message:<br><textarea name=\"message\"></textarea></p>\n",
    "    <p><button type=\"submit\">Send</button></p>\n",
    "</form>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above describes 2 fields, one small asking for a name, and another to write a message in. When you click the Send button, the form is \"submitted\", meaning that the content of its field is packed into an HTTP request and the browser might make a request to this URL: \n",
    "\n",
    "GET /example/message.html?name=Jean&message=Yes%3F HTTP/1.1\n",
    "\n",
    "The question mark indicates the end of the path part of the URL and the start of the query. It is followed by pairs of names and values, corresponding to the name attributes on the form field elements and the content of those elements. An ampersand(&) is used to separate those pairs. \n",
    "\n",
    "The actual message encoded in the URL is \"Yes?\", but the question mark is replaced by a strange code. Some characters in query strings must be escaped. URL has its own format called URL encoding, which uses a percent sign followed by 2 hexadecimal digits that encode the character code. E.g. ? is represented as %3F. The functions encodeURIComponenet and decodeURIComponent are used to encode and decode this format:"

    "\n",
    "## Fetch\n",
    "\n",
    "The interface through which browser JavaScript can make HTTP requests is called fetch, which uses Promises. E.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```JavaScript\n",
    "fetch(\"example/message.html\").then(response => {\n",
    "    console.log(response.status);\n",
    "    // -> 200\n",
    "    console.log(response.headers.get(\"Content-Type\"));\n",
    "});\n",
    "```\n",
    "The promise returns a response object holding information about the server's response, including status code and headers. The headers are wrapped in a Map-like object that treats its keys as case-insensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first argument to fetch is the URL that should be requested. When that path doesn't start with a protocol name (such as http:), it is requested as relative, which means that it is interpreted relative to the current document. When it starts with /, it replaces the current path, which is the part after the server name. When it does not, the part of the current path up to and including its last slash character is put in front of the relative URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the actual text of a response, you can use its text method, this also returns a promise since the original response promise is resolved as soon as the headers are loaded, while the body might take a while longer.\n",
    "\n",
    "```JS\n",
    "fetch(\"example/data.txt\")\n",
    "    .then(resp => resp.text())\n",
    "    .then(text => console.log(text));\n",
    "    // -> The actual content of data.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar method, called json, returns a promise that resolves to the value you get when parsing the body as JSON or rejects if it's not valid JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, fetch uses the GET method to make its request and does not include a request body. You can configure it differently by passing an object with extra options as a second argument. E.g. this request tries to delete example/data.txt. The 405 status code means method is not allowed.\n",
    "fetch(\"example/data.txt\", {method: \"DELETE\"}).then(resp => {\n",
    "    console.log(resp.status);\n",
    "});\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a request body, you can include a body option. To set headers, there's the headers option. For example, this request includes a Range header, which instructs the server to return only part of a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "```JS\n",
    "fetch(\"example/data.txt\", \"headers\" {Range: \"bytes=8-19\"}})\n",
    "    .then(resp => resp.text())\n",
    "    .then(console.log);\n",
    "    // -> the content\n",
    "```\n",
    "The browser will automatically add some request headers, such as \"Host\" and those needed for the server to figure out the size of the body. But adding your own headers is often useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "## HTTP Sandboxing\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to security concerns, browsers do not allow scripts to make HTTP requests to other domains. However, this can prevent servers from making legitimate uses of cross-domain scripting. Servers can include a header like this in their response to indicate to the browser that it is okay for the requests to come from another domain:\n",
    "\n",
    "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *\n",
    "\n",
    "## Appreciating HTTP\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a system that requires communication between a JavaScript program running in the background and a program running on a server, there are several ways to model this communication. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first model, called remote procedure calls, follows the pattern of normal function calls, execpet that the function is actually running on another machine. Calling it involves making a request to the server that includes the function name and arguments. The response to that request contains the returned value. \n",
    "\n",
    "When thinking of RPCs, HTTP is just a vehicle for commucation, as there will like be an abstraction layer written on top of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second model, called REST, builds communication around the concept of resources and HTTP methods. Instead of a remote procedure called addUser, you use a PUT request to /users/larry. Instead of encoding that user's properties in a function argument, you define a JSON document format (or use an existing format) that represents a user. A resource is fetched by making a GET request to the resource URL (e.g. /user/larry), which again returns the document representing the resource.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second approach makes it easier to use some of the features that HTTP provides, such as support for caching resouces (keeping a copy on the client side for fast access). The concepts used in HTTP, provide a helpful set of principles to design your server interface around. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Security and HTTPS\n",
    "\n",
    "Data travelling over the internet usually travels a long way to reach its destination. This exposes it to many malicious users who may inspect or modify the data. Using plain HTTP is not sufficiently secure when transfering sensitive data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The secure HTTP protocol, HTTPS, wraps HTTP traffic in a way that makes it more secure. First, it authenticates the server by asking it to prove its identity by proving it has a cryptographic certificate issued by a certificate authority that the browser recognizes. Next, all data going over the connection is encrypted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Form Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Forms fields were orignally designed to allow users to send information as an HTTP request. They were originally designed such that interaction with the server always happens by navigating to a new page. But their elements are part of the DOM like the rest of the page, and DOM elements that represent form fields support a number of properties and events that are not present on other elements. This allows us to inspect and control input fields with JS programs and do things such as adding new functionality to a form or using forms and fields as building blocks in a JS application.\n",
    "\n",
    "A web form consists of any number of form fields surounded by a `<form>` tag. HTML allows several different style of form fields, ranging from drop-down menus, to checkboxes, and fields for text input. A lof of field types use the `<input>` tag. This tag's attribute is used to select the field's style. These are some of the `<input>` types:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ text: A single-line text field\n",
    "+ password: Same as text but hides the text that is typed\n",
    "+ checkbox: An on/off switch\n",
    "+ radio: Part of a multiple choice field\n",
    "+ file: Allows the user to choose a file from their computer\n",
    "\n",
    "Form fields do not have to appear in a `<form>` tag. They can appear anywhere in a page. Such form-less fields cannot be submitted (only a whole form can), but when responding to input with JS, we often don't want to submit our fields normally anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "```HTML\n",
    "<p><input type=\"text\" value=\"abc\"> (text)</p>\n",
    "<p><input type=\"password\" value=\"abc\"> (password)</p>\n",
    "<p><input type=\"checkbox\" checked> (checkbox) </p>\n",
    "<p><input type=\"radio\" value=\"A\" name=\"choice\"> \n",
    "    <input type=\"radio\" value=\"B\" name=\"choice\" checked>\n",
    "    <input type=\"radio\" value=\"C\" name=\"choice\"> (radio)</p>\n",
    "<p><input type=\"file\"> (file)</p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The JavaScript interface for such elements differs with the type of element. Multiline text fields have their own tag, `<textarea>`, which  uses the text between the two tags as starting text.\n",
    "\n",
    "```HTML\n",
    "<textarea>\n",
    "    One\n",
    "    Two\n",
    "    Three\n",
    "</textarea>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `<select>` tag creates a field that allows the user to choose among a few predefined options.\n",
    "\n",
    "```HTML\n",
    "<select>\n",
    "    <option>Pancakes</option>\n",
    "    <option>Pudding</option>\n",
    "</select>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever the value of a form changes, it will fire a \"change\" event.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Focus\n",
    "\n",
    "Form fields can get *keyboard focus*, which occurs when they are clicked or activated in some way. This allows them to be the recipient of keyboard input. Text fields can only recieve typed input if they have keyboard focus. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other fields respond differently to keyboard input, e.g. a `<select>` menu tries to highlight the option that the user typed, and responds to the arrow keys by moving its selection up and down.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can change focus with the .focus() and .blur() methods. The first moves focus to the DOM element it is called on, while the second removes it. The value in document.activeElement corresponds to the element that currently focused element. \n",
    "\n",
    "```HTML\n",
    "<input type=\"text\">\n",
    "<script>\n",
    "  document.querySelector(\"input\").focus();\n",
    "  console.log(document.activeElement.tagname);\n",
    "  // -> INPUT\n",
    "  document.querySelector(\"input\").blur();\n",
    "  console.log(document.activeElement.tagname);\n",
    "  // -> BODY\n",
    "</script>\n",
    "```\n",
    "For some pages, the user is expected to want to interact with a form field immediately. JavaScript can be used to focus on this form field immediately when the page is loaded, but HTML also provides the autofocus attribute, which produces the same effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Browsers also allow the user to move the focus through the document by pressing the TAB key. We can change the order in which elements receive focus with the tabindex attribute. E.g. this allows us to skip the help link:\n",
    "\n",
    "```HTML\n",
    "<input type=\"text\" tabindex=1> <a href=\".\">(help)</a>\n",
    "<button onClick=\"console.log('ok')\" tabindex=2>OK</button>\n",
    "```\n",
    "By default, most types of HTML elements cannot be focused. But you can add a tabindex attribute to any element that will make it focusable. A tabindex of -1 makes tabbing skip over an element, even if its normally focusable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disabled Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "All form fields can be disabled through their disabled attribute. It is an attribute that can be specified without value, disabled fields cannot be focused or changed, e.g.\n",
    "\n",
    "```HTML\n",
    "<button>Working button</button>\n",
    "<button disabled>I'm out</button>\n",
    "```\n",
    "<button>Working button</button>\n",
    "<button disabled>I'm out</button>\n",
    "\n",
    "This might be useful when a program is in the process of handling an action caused by a button that might require communicating with the server that happens to be taking a long time. By disabling the button, we can ensure that the user won't click on the button again, out of impatience.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The form as a whole\n",
    "\n",
    "When a field is in a `<form>` tag, its DOM element will have a form property linking back to the form's DOM element. The `<form>` element, in turn, has a property called elements that contains an array-like collection of the fields inside it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name attribute of a form field determines the way its value will be identified when the form is submitted. It can also be used as a property name when accessing the form's elements property, which acts both as an array-like object (accessible by number) and a map (accessible by name).\n",
    "\n",
    "```HTML\n",
    "<form action=\"example/submit.html\">\n",
    "    Name: <input type=\"text\" name=\"name\"><br>\n",
    "    Password: <input type=\"password\" name=\"password\"><br>\n",
    "    <button type=\"submit\">Log in</button>\n",

    "</script>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "A button with a type attribute of submit, when pressed, will cause the form to be submitted, which is the same as pressing enter when the form field is focused. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a form is submitted, the browser navigates to the page indicated by the form's action attribute, using either a GET or POST request. But before that happens, a submit event is fired. You can handle this with JS and prevent the default behaviour by calling preventDefault on the event object.\n",
    "\n",
    "```HTML\n",
    "<form action=\"example/action.html\">\n",

    "</script>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can interrupt submit events for various reasons, one is to verify that users have submitted information that makes sense, and to show errors immediately instead of submitting the wrong information. Or we can disable the regular way of submitting the form completelt, and have our program handle the input, by using fetch to send it to a server without reloading the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Text Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "Fields created with a `<textarea>` or `<input>` with a text or password type shared a common interface. Their DOM elements have a value property that holds their current content as a string value, which we can set to another string that chanages the field's content. \n",
    "\n",
    "The selectionStart and selectionEnd properties of text fields give us information about the cursor and selection in the text. When nothing is selected, these two properties are the same. But if some text is selected, then the two properties will differ, giving us the start and end of the selected text. These values may also be written to.\n",

    "Select fields are similar to radio buttons, as they allow the user to choose from a set of options. But where a radio button puts the layout of the options under our control, the appearance of a `<select>` tag is determined by the browser. Select fields also have a variant that is more akin to checkboxes than radio buttons. When given the multiple attribute, a `<select>` tag will allow the user to select any number of options, rather than just a single option. Most browsers will display this differently than a select field, which is just drop down. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each `<option>` tag has a value. This value can be defined with a value attribute. When that is not given, the text inside the option will count as its value. The value property of a `<select>` element reflects the currently selected option. The option tags for a `<select>` field can be accessed as an array-like object through the field's options property. Each option has a property called selected, which indicates whether that option is selected.\n",

    "The files property of a file field is an Array-like object, containing the files chosen in the field. The reason there isn't a file property is that the file fields also supports a \"multiple\" attribute, which makes it possible to select multipel files at the same time.\n",

    "Objects in the files objects have properties such as name, size, and type (e.g. text/plain or image/jpeg). However, it does not have a property that contains the content of the file.\n",
