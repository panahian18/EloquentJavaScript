    //  Tracking the scalpel

/* The village crows own an old scalpel that they occasionally use on special
*  missionsâ€”say, to cut through screen doors or packaging. To be able to
*  quickly track it down, every time the scalpel is moved to another nest,
*  an entry is added to the storage of both the nest that had it and the
*  nest that took it, under "scalpel", pointing at its new location.
*  This means that finding the scalpel is a matter of following the breadcrumb
*  trail of storage entries, until you find a nest where that points at
*  the nest itself.
*
*
* 1.Write an async function locateScalpel that does this, starting at the
*   nest on which it runs. You can use the anyStorage function defined
*   earlier to access storage in arbitrary nests. The scalpel has been going
*   around long enough that you may assume that every nest has a "scalpel"
*   entry in its data storage.
*
* 2.Next, write the same function again without using async and await.
*
* 3.Do request failures properly show up as rejections of the returned
*   promise in both versions? How?
