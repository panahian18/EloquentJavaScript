    "\n",
    "One of the most difficult aspects of writing programs that communicate over a network is managing input and output, that is data going from the network and hard drive. Especially in a way that schedules it efficiently. In such a program, asynchronous programming is often helpful, as it allows the program to send and receive data from multiple devices at the same time without complicated thread management and synchronization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Node was initially conceived for the purpose of making asyncrhonous programming easy and convenient. Asyncrhonous programs allow the program send and receive data from and to multiple devices at the same time without complicated thread management and synchronization. JS does not have a built-in appraoch to do input and output, which allows it to easily adopt node's way of I/O."
