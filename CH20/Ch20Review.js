        // Node.js

// Node.js is a program that allows us to run javascript outside of the browser.
// It can be used to write anything from command line tools to HTTP servers.

// One of the most difficult aspects of writing programs that communicate over
// a network is managing input and output, that is data going to and from the
// network and hard drive. Especially in a way that schedules it efficiently.
// In such a program, asynchronous programming is often helpful, as it allows
// the program to send and receive data from multiple devices at the same time
// without complicated thread management and synchronization.

// Node was initially conceived for the purpose of making asynchronous
// programming easy and convenient. This is because JS does not have a built in
// approach to do in- and output.
